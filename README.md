This contains colab having models on which we have performed the experiment for flower classification over Oxford 102 dataset. 

Data : We performed below  experiments on Oxford102 dataset . Each file contains dataset downloading and downsampled code as we directly downloaded our dataset in files .

knn_Flower_Recoginition_oxford102 : This file  contains dataset code and experiments on KNN model using oxford102 dataset  from which we received 32% accuracy .

Flower Recognition_NN & CNN : It contains dataset code, NN model and CNN model. We achieved NN accuracy of 39.7 %.

Flower Recognition_Revised CNN : It contains CNN model having higher accuracy than earlier model which is 53.92 %. CNN with regularization is also implemented in this file which results in the accuracy of 58.51%.

Transfer Learning_Flower_Recoginition_oxford102 : This file contains dataset code and transfer learning model experiments . This is our best model as we achieved an accuracy of 75.85 % .

DataAugmentation_FlowerRecognition : This file contain dataset code and code where we performed data augmentation on our downsampled dataset and also the model code on which we performed experiments using Augmented dataset and achieved an accuracy of 46.07%
